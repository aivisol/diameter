"""Diameter node classes.
This package contains classes for dealing with and implementing Diameter nodes.

How to create a node:.
  1: The first step in creating a Diameter Node is creating a set of
     capabilities. This is later on used for negotiating with peers.
     The capability set includes supported applications and vendor-IDs.
  2: The next step is creating a NodeSettings instance. A NodeSettings
     instance specifies the settings for your node including the
     capabilities, host-ID, etc.
  3: Then you are ready to create a Node, and NodeManager or SimpleSyncClient.
